# Advent of Code
### **My code written for "Advent of Code" 2024<br>**

[Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I was motivated by our lecturer and wanted to beat the challenge 3 years later.
## Days 1 - 7
**Day 1** was self explainatory.<br>

**Day 2** I had a small problem with re-trying the reports without one of the levels, but wrote a function to test all cases.<br>

**Day 3** came with [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) problem. After a bit of research and tutorials of [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) library in python, i completed part 1. Part 2 was tricky, but I am proud of my program. It divided corrupted memory into list of actions, that were later interpreted accordingly. <br>

**Day 4** was **hard**. I came up with an easy algorithm to set the input **string to a matrix** and then check words looking at "X"'s neighbours. The _hard part was coding it_. After a bit of help from ChatGPT I coded a checker in every dimension. Part 2 was surprising, but kind of easier. I checked for letters **"A"** in matrix and checked if words completed from diagonals matched the key: ```["MAS", "SAM"]```<br>

**Day 5** challenge was tricky, i quickly came up with my data structure - organizing things into lists _again_. Then for orders I checked for every order if update was correct. For part 2 I added searching for incorrect and a function to correct the orders.
