# Advent of Code
### **My code written for "Advent of Code" 2024<br>**

[Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I was motivated by our lecturer and wanted to beat the challenge 3 years later.
### Days 1 - 3
Fairly easy challenges. **Day 1** was self explainatory.
In **Day 2** I had a small problem with re-trying the reports without one of the levels, but wrote a function to test all cases.
**Day 3** came with [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) problem. After a bit of research and tutorials of [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) library in python, i completed part 1. Part 2 was tricky, but I am proud of my program. It divided corrupted memory into list of actions, that were later interpreted accordingly. <br>
