# Advent of Code
### **My code written for "Advent of Code" 2024<br>**

[Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I was motivated by our lecturer and wanted to beat the challenge 3 years later.
### Days 1 - 2
Fairly easy challenges. Day 1 was self explainatory.
In Day 2 I had a small problem with re-trying the reports without one of the levels, but wrote a function to test all cases. <br>
_score: 4/4 stars <br>
